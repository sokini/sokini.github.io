title: Welcome to PDP2023's Parsons problem inteartive tool
---


This page serves as the main index for the Parsons problems that we will host each week. If you have any questions about this tool please contact me at luil@itu.dk 

Here are the instructions to keep in mind while using the tool:

> Drag or shuffle the blocks of code in the practice problems. Remember to indent where appropriate by dragging blocks to the right.
> To check your work, press the "Get Feedback" button. To start over, press the "Reset Problem" button. 

Please note: We are working on changing the colours so that they can be colour-blind friendly
