title: Welcome to PDP2025's Parson's problem interactive tool
---


This page serves as the main index for the Parson's problems that we will host each week. If you have any questions about this tool please reach out to lecturer Sofie at soni@itu.dk.

Here are the instructions to keep in mind while using the tool:

> Drag or shuffle the blocks of code in the practice problems. Remember to indent where appropriate by dragging blocks to the right.
> To check your work, press the "Get Feedback" button. To start over, press the "Reset Problem" button. 

Please note: We are working on changing the colours so that they can be colour-blind friendly
