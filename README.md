# PDP2024 Parsons puzzle repository

This repository hosts the different interactive parsons puzzles for the class Programming and Data Processing. This repository is a fork of an open tool made available by Codio. You can find the original repo here: https://github.com/codio-content/hosting-parsons-on-github-template 

This is the second time we are using such a tool, and some bugs may still be present.

If you are curious as to how this tool works, check out their repository. If you would like to host a Parsons problem or are interested in using it in a similar way to ours, send Luis, who was responsible for the first version an email at luil@itu.dk

Happy puzzling :)
